coretest_bpaysan_entropy
========================

Coretest system for testing the FPGA based entropy source developed by Bernd Paysan.

## Introduction ##
This project is a coretest system dedicated to test entropy sources
within a FPGA device. The specific entropy source has ben designed by
Bernd Paysan.

The entropy source used two sets of 16 free running digital oscillators
that are interconnected.
